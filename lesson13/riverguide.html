        <p>In the northern hemisphere, summer is the warmest season of the year; extending from the summer solstice through to the autumnal equinox. This season introduces the raining season, because of the heat, water is evaporated and the vapours are safely stored in the atmosphere, in turn these vapours are turned into clouds that fall as rain for four months.
        <br> <br>
        Summer is especially warm because during this time that part of the earth is directly under the sun and its rays are focused on the area, drying up ponds and lakes; this has/can lead to a scarcity of water. For most people this time of the year is associated with fun as schools break on holidays and most offices are not fully active.
        <br> <br>
        Summer brings back lots of outdoor social activities impossible in the freezing cold winter. Most people visit picnics, beaches and parks to relax and unwind themselves under clear skies. For the party rockers, summer time is ‘open season’ so many parties are held to take advantage of the fine weather ,with clear skies the summer hosts a very bright moon, ideal for this purpose.
        <br> <br>
        This season brings bright and longer days, which exposes the beauty of nature, grasses are green, flowers bloom and myriad birds and animals return to the melted and blossoming fields. Everyone dresses with light materials to feel cool under the hot sun; most will be spotted in shorts, sunglasses, summer dresses and scandals. Some fruits such as mangos and pineapples, become ripe during summer, so this season present the opportunity for people to enjoy them.
